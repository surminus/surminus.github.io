        <title>Being Transgender at GDS</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Foreword: I wrote this blog post for Cabinet Office and GDS, and it was originally published &lt;a href=&quot;https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2016/09/28/being-transgender-at-gds/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week is National Inclusion Week, and Cabinet Office is publishing its first ever Gender Identity and Gender Reassignment Policy. I feel like this is a good opportunity to write about my experience of being transgender and transitioning to my identified gender while working as a civil servant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2016, at the age of 31, I decided that I wanted to transition full time to live my life as a woman rather than as a man. During 2015 I had come out as transgender to everyone outside of work, and at this point I was already living much of my time in this role.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Making the switch at the office felt like the final hurdle, and I could finally formally change my name and title to reflect how I wanted the world to see me. I spend most of my life at work, so in practical terms this really was the “big push”. I also have to regularly forge relationships and work alongside people who do not know anything about me personally. This means that having a supportive work environment was integral for me to have the confidence not just to make these changes at work, but to finally establish my entire life the way I had always dreamt about. It also meant that I needed to ensure that it did not impact my career or professional life, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, I work with lots of great people. I’ve been working at GDS for over 2 years, and one of the things that really struck me when I first joined was the open conversations about identity politics compared to my previous places of work. Knowing that people, particularly my immediate team, were aware and informed about transgender issues was an enormous confidence boost. It was a huge reason why I felt I could make that big jump. It made something that was unspeakably terrifying to myself into something that was a plausible option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing that your colleagues have an understanding of what you might be going through is incredibly reassuring. And this is why something like National Inclusion Week and an official policy for trans folk is so important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I spoke to our People Team about announcing my transition to my colleagues, I was told that there was no policy and they asked me how I would like to approach it. I did not want to make a big deal about it, but I wanted it to be communicated en masse. I didn’t want to have to endlessly explain to individuals that I was changing my name and repeatedly ask people to refer to me as “her”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I picked a date and, as requested, it was communicated simply as a footnote at the end of a weekly all-staff email. The next day came around, and that was it. Colleagues used the right name and pronouns, and I have had an entirely positive experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knew that some people might have questions: I think that’s natural, and I always try to encourage people to be open rather than feel awkward around me. The main thing is that I am treated with respect, and I have never had a problem with that at GDS. The culture is one of the big draws, and while this has been my only position in the Civil Service, I would like to think that people have a similar positive experience to mine elsewhere. Having other inclusive networks available, such as the LGBT+ Network or Women’s Group, is also key to ensure that people know they have a space to freely and openly discuss issues that may be affecting them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me, National Inclusion Week is about drawing on these experiences and hoping people understand that language and actions within a workplace are incredibly important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was fortunate enough that my colleagues empowered me to finally get on with something I should have done a long time ago. But there will be times when language and actions have a serious negative effect and make one of your colleagues feel excluded. This can have direct consequences on not just their work, and subsequently the team as a whole, but the rest of their life. Having that awareness and respect for others can make a huge change in someone’s life, and it’s important we all understand the difference we can make.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Updating this blog in Google Container Engine</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;boil-the-kettle-and-make-a-cup-of-tea&quot;&gt;Boil the kettle and make a cup of tea&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that really fascinates me in new tech is &lt;a href=&quot;http://kubernetes.io/&quot;&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt;.
Unfortunately it seems unlikely that we’ll be using in my current role anytime soon,
so I decided to simultaneously have a play and add some content at the same time; and
when I say have a play, I mean use &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/container-engine/&quot;&gt;Google Container Engine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My problem is I always try to do too much and get overwhelmed, but this time
I made myself keep it simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the Google &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcloud&lt;/code&gt; toolkit: it’s straight forward and documentation
is excellent. This site was originally running on a VM in &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/compute/&quot;&gt;Google Compute&lt;/a&gt;,
and the experience for bringing up a basic VM was as it should be: quick auth, a couple of commands,
and an easy way to get data back for interaction. Super.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to do was create an image of the site using Docker. Since I’m
using &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, this was trivial. I &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/surminus/blog/blob/master/Dockerfile&quot;&gt;created a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Dockerfile&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,
with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;startup.sh&lt;/code&gt; containing &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/surminus/blog/blob/master/startup.sh&quot;&gt;some binding info&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I built the image with the tag &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/container-registry/docs/pushing&quot;&gt;documented by Google Container Registry&lt;/a&gt;. For the purposes
here I’ll just refer to it as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;$TAG&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker build -t &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TAG&lt;/span&gt; .&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run it to make sure it’s OK…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;docker run &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TAG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…and push it to the registry:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcloud docker push &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TAG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next we need to make a cluster to run our &lt;a href=&quot;http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/pods/&quot;&gt;“pods”&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/container/clusters/create&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gcloud container clusters create blog&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This can take a little while, probably just enough time to drink the tea you made right at the beginning. When that’s done,
and you feel sufficiently warmed by the tea, it’s time to push our image into the cluster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;kubectl run blog --image&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$TAG&lt;/span&gt; --port&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;4000&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we get to see the service, we need to expose it a load balancer:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;kubectl expose deployment blog --port&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;80 --target-port&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;4000 --type&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;LoadBalancer&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note the port forwarding; it’s running on tcp/4000 in the container, so we need to tell
the load balancer to forward traffic to it appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grab the external IP of the deployment using:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;➜  blog git:&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;master&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ✗ kubectl get service blog
NAME      CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;S&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;   AGE
blog      10.3.252.135   23.251.133.125   80/TCP    1m&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll probably be in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;pending&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; for perhaps a minute or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see some fuller information of this deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;➜  blog git:&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;master&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; ✗ kubectl describe service blog

&lt;h2 id=&quot;updating-my-dns&quot;&gt;Updating my DNS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I have something running in Google Container Engine, and it was all pretty
straight forward. Unfortunately I still need to update the DNS, but fortunately
that’s also hosted at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s find out the current state:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcloud dns record-sets list -z &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ZONENAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To add/edit/remove a record, you must start a transaction:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcloud dns record-sets transaction start -z &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ZONENAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I already had a record set up for this, so I had to remove it, which is exactly the
same command as below, except replacing &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;remove&lt;/code&gt; for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;add&lt;/code&gt;. The following adds my new
record;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcloud dns record-sets transaction add 23.251.133.125 --name blog.surminus.co.uk. --ttl 300 --type A -z &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ZONENAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then execute the change, and view the changes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-bash&quot; data-lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;gcloud dns record-sets transaction execute -z &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ZONENAME&lt;/span&gt;
gcloud dns record-sets list -z &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ZONENAME&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I know setting the TTL makes me a rebel without a cause. Suck it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;thats-it&quot;&gt;That’s it!&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this then it must have worked, and I actually have some content on my blog. Goodness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;update&quot;&gt;Update:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the guide above creates a default 3 node Kubernetes cluster in the Google Compute,
which costs a bit of money. I now actually host using Github pages. The LoadBalancing also costs,
and it’s probably more effective to just have an nginx instance running somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

        <description>&lt;p&gt;I was bored so decided to create a site because I feel like I should have
&lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is all.&lt;/p&gt;
